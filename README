Welcome and thanks for trying and testing twitcli.

Twitcli is a command line based twitter application for linux.
It's only in version 1.0 (or whatever) and is pretty simple so far.
Your start by simply running the script with perl twitcli.pl 
This will run the script and ask you to authorize the app if it's your first time.
Your timeline will then be output along with a command prompt.
The app only has two commands thus far.
"update" will update the timeline.
"tweet" will post a new tweet.


Thanks again!
